  <h3>Scheduler Options</h3>
  <h4>Schedule Type</h4>
  <div class='offset-sm-1'>
    <h4>Tournament</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the number of players and we create a schedule so that everyone plays each other once.</li>
      <li>Can be used with singles or teams.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>King of the Court</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your opponents will be determined by who you have played against the least.</li>
      <li>Your court assignment is determined by which court you,
        your partner, and your opponents have played on least.</li>
      <li>This will also optimise your playing time by evenly spreading out your byes.</li>
      <li>This can be played with singles, teams, or individuals wanting to play doubles.</li>
      <li>If you have individuals wanting to play doubles, then:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Individual players are partnered up.</li>
        <li>You get a different partner every match.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h4>Number of Players / Number of Teams</h4>
  <div>
    You can enter the number of players or teams.  You can also choose to "Load from Group". To use a group you will need the
    following:
    <ul>
      <li>Player Contacts - This is a contact list of everyone you know that plays pickleball</li>
      <li>Groups - Create groups for the groups you play in. Like "Mentor League on Tuesday".</li>
      <li>Group Players - This allows you to add your Player Contacts to each group that they play in.
        Once a player is added to a group, they can be enabled <i class='fa fa-star'></i> or disabled
        <i class='fa fa-thumbs-down'></i>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br>
  <h4>Number of Courts</h4>
  <div> This is the number of courts you will be playing on. If you enter more
    courts than you can use, it will only use the courts you need. For example if you have 8 people
    playing King of the Court and you enter 4 courts.  The scheduler will only use 2 courts.
    You don't have enough people to use more than 2 courts.
  </div>
  <br>
  <h4>Randomize Order</h4>
  <div>When this is selected it will randomize the order of people you will play.
    Without this selected you will get the same schedule every time.
  </div>
  <br>
  <h4>Use Names for Matches</h4>
  <div>When this is selected it will display the players name in the schedule
    instead of listing the player numbers. This is only available if you use "Load from Group".
