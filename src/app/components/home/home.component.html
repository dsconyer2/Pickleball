    Welcome to the Pickleball Scheduler. This will allow you to schedule different types of formats. We currently only
    support one division at a time. The schedule will setup matches between players and it will organize matches into
    rounds. It will also determine which players will need to sit out each round.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Quick Start</h3>
  <p>
    Have your players count off. This will assign each player a number and you will determine how many players you have.
    Click on Scheduler. Select the scheduler type, enter the number of players and courts, then select Start. This
    will give you a schedule based on player number.

  <h3>Options</h3>
  <h4>Schedule Type</h4>
  <div class='offset-sm-1'>
    <h4>Tournament</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the number of players and we create a schedule so that everyone plays each other once.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>King of the Court</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Individual players are partnered up.</li>
      <li>You get a different partner every match.</li>
      <li>Your opponents will be determined by who you have played against the least.</li>
      <li>Your court assignment is determined by which court you,
        your partner, and your opponents have played on least.</li>
      <li>This will also optimise your playing time by evenly spreading out your byes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h4>Number of Players</h4>
  <div>
    You can enter the number of players or choose to "Load from Group". To use a group you will need the
    following:
    <ul>
      <li>Player Contacts - This is a contact list of everyone you know that plays pickleball</li>
      <li>Groups - Create groups for the groups you play in. Like "Mentor League on Tuesday".</li>
      <li>Group Players - This allows you to add your Player Contacts to each group that they play in.
        Once a player is added to a group, they can be enabled <i class='fa fa-star'></i> or disabled
         <i class='fa fa-thumbs-down'></i>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Number of Courts</h4>
    <div> This is the number of courts you will be playing on. You can't more
      courts than what you can use. For example if you have 8 people playing King of the Court,
      then you can use 1 or 2 courts. You don't have enough people to use more than 2 courts.
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Randomize Order</h4>
    <div>When this is selected it will randomize the order of people you will play.
      Without this selected you will get the same schedule every time.
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Use Names for Matches</h4>
    <div>When this is selected it will display the players name in the schedule
      instead of listing the player numbers. This is only available if you use "Load from Group".
